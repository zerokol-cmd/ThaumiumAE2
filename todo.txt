priorities:
void jar  and brain jar transforms into regular jar on output
Essentia put on empty slots
Dump all button
Item frames

















1. proper gui positioning

2 implement terminal view only
	2.2 implement easy to use terminal for getting and putting essentia

3 buses
	3.1 import bus
	3.2 export bus
	3.3 export bus
4. profile terminal open. why it's so slow?

backlog:
✅ 1 implement cell done??
✅ 2.  Rewrite essentia sync manager.



bugs:
1 me drive does not display drive on block itself. probably because GTNH version relies on methods such as IsFluid/IsItem





maybe todo:
1 allow placing PartEssentiaTermina on ground:
	debug PartEssentiaTermina.canBePlacedOn to be possible to place on a non cable


Refactor todo:
Rename implementation -> internals/private
Rename contents -> features
Rename ITAE2EssentiaStack -> IEssentiaStack
