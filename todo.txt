	2.1 implement IStorageSystem for EssentiaStack or find a way around
	2.2 implement easy to use terminal for getting and putting essentia
3 export + import bus
	3.1

backlog:
✅ 1 implement cell done??



bugs:
1 me drive does not display drive on block itself. probably because GTNH version relies on methods such as IsFluid/IsItem





maybe todo:
1 allow placing PartEssentiaTermina on ground:
	debug PartEssentiaTermina.canBePlacedOn to be possible to place on a non cable


Refactor todo:
Rename implementation -> internals/private
Rename contents -> features
Rename ITAE2EssentiaStack -> IEssentiaStack
