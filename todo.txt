priorities:
✅ 1 implement cell done??
2 implement terminal view only
	2.1 implement IStorageSystem for EssentiaStack or find a way around
	2.2 implement easy to use terminal for getting and putting essentia
3 export + import bus
	3.1




bugs:
1 me drive does not display drive on block itself. probably because GTNH version relies on methods such as IsFluid/IsItem





maybe todo:
1 allow placing PartEssentiaTermina on ground:
	debug PartEssentiaTermina.canBePlacedOn to be possible to place on a non cable
